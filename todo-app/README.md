# Zero Source Todo Application

## Description

A minimalist yet powerful todo list application built using the Zero Source methodology. It allows users to manage tasks with priorities, due dates, and categories while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.

## Functionality

### Core Features

- Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Add due dates to tasks
- Categorize tasks with custom categories
- Filter and sort tasks by various attributes
- Persistent storage of tasks
- Dark/light theme support

### User Interface

The interface should consist of:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ‚úèÔ∏è My Todo List                      üåô [Search] |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ‚ûï Add New Task                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Filters: All | Active | Completed                 |
| Sort: Date ‚ñº | Priority | Alphabetical           |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ‚òê High | Buy groceries           | Today    | üóëÔ∏è  |
| ‚òë Med  | Call dentist            | Yesterday| üóëÔ∏è  |
| ‚òê Low  | Finish presentation     | Mar 15   | üóëÔ∏è  |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Completed: 1 | Remaining: 2                       |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

- Header with app name and theme toggle
- Search bar for filtering tasks
- Add new task button/form
- Filter and sort controls
- Task list with checkbox, priority indicator, task name, due date, and delete button
- Status bar showing task completion statistics

### Task Creation/Editing

When adding or editing a task, display a form with:
- Task name field (required)
- Priority selector (Low/Medium/High)
- Due date picker (optional)
- Category selector with option to create new categories
- Notes field for additional details (optional)
- Save and Cancel buttons

### Task Interaction

- Click on checkbox to toggle completion status
- Click on task name to edit task
- Swipe left (mobile) or hover and click delete icon to remove task
- Completed tasks should have a strikethrough style

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model

Each task should be represented as an object with:

```javascript
{
  id: string,           // Unique identifier
  title: string,        // Task name
  completed: boolean,   // Completion status
  priority: "low" | "medium" | "high",
  dueDate: Date | null, // Optional due date
  category: string | null, // Optional category
  notes: string | null, // Optional additional information
  createdAt: Date,      // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date       // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Storage

- Use local storage for persistent data
- Implement data synchronization if offline capability required
- Store tasks in a structured format that allows efficient filtering/sorting

### State Management

- Maintain application state including:
  - Current tasks
  - Filter settings
  - Sort order
  - Current theme
  - Active modal/dialog state

### User Experience Considerations

1. Task Creation:
   - Quick add capability (just title) with default priority medium
   - Advanced add with all fields
   - Autocomplete for categories

2. Task Management:
   - Batch operations (delete multiple, mark multiple complete)
   - Drag-and-drop reordering
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

3. Feedback:
   - Confirmation for task deletion
   - Undo capability for major actions
   - Visual feedback for completion (brief animation)
   - Due date approaching/overdue notifications

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Different layouts for:
  - Mobile: Single column, swipe actions, bottom navigation
  - Tablet: Two-column layout
  - Desktop: Multi-column with sidebar for filters/categories

## Accessibility Requirements

- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigable interface
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Focus management for forms and interactive elements
- Text scaling support

## Performance Goals

- Initial load under 2 seconds
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Responsive to input with no perceptible lag
- Efficient handling of large task lists (1000+ items) without performance degradation

## Extended Features (Optional)

- Recurring tasks
- Subtasks/checklists within tasks
- Time estimates for tasks
- Tags for cross-category organization
- Task sharing/collaboration
- Data export/import
- Task statistics and productivity insights

## Implementation Notes

- Prioritize a clean, focused UI over feature bloat
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus states
- Use consistent iconography throughout the application
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Optimize for both mouse and touch interactions
